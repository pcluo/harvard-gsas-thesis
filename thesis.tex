\usepackage{etex} % extend the number of registers

% GSAS: "all margins should be at least 1 inch."
\usepackage[margin={1.2in}]{geometry}
% If you want asymmetric margins for two-sided documents, use the "twoside"
% option, as in
% \usepackage[top=1in,bottom=1.5in,left=1in,right=1.5in,twoside]{geometry} The
% left and right options become inner and outer margins The default horizontal
% latex margin ratio is 2:3. The default vertical top:bottom margin ratio is 2:3
% also. You can also set it directly by passing the hmarginratio option to the
% geometry package, as in
% \usepackage[top=1in,left=1in,vmarginratio=2:3,hmarginratio=2:5,twoside]{geometry}

% Appendix package. Not necessary, but it does make managing appendices easier
\usepackage[titletoc]{appendix}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FRONTMATTER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\pagenumbering{roman} % GSAS wants roman page numbers for frontmatter

% the following four pages are required in that order. The first two pages are
% not allowed to have page numbers, this is taken care of in the class file.
\thesistitlepage
\copyrightpage
\begin{abstract}
  An abstract should be less than 350 words. Here's some filler text. \blindtext
\end{abstract}

% Center headings for table of contents, LOT, and LOF and make them smaller so
% that "Abstract", "Acknowledgments" and "Contents" all look alike. Comment out
% if you want the default. If you want more control, use the "tocloft" package.
\renewcommand{\contentsname}{\protect\centering\protect\Large Contents}
\renewcommand{\listtablename}{\protect\centering\protect\Large List of Tables}
\renewcommand{\listfigurename}{\protect\centering\protect\Large List of Figures}

\tableofcontents % Table of contents

% The rest of the front matter: Lists of tables, figures, dedication and
% acknowledment is optional. Comment out whatever you don't like
\listoftables

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MAIN BODY %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\pagenumbering{arabic} % reset page numbering and switch to arabic

% Introductory chapter. Comment out if you don't have an intro chapter, but I
% think most committees expect you to have one.
% Don't number the intro chapter, but add to to the table of contents

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BACK MATTER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Put appendices, bibliography, and supplemental materials here

% The bibliography may be single spaced within each entry, but must be
% double-spaced between each entry. Most bibliography styles leave space between
% entries, so that shouldn't be a problem.
\begin{singlespacing}
  % I like "References" better than "Bibliography"
  \renewcommand{\bibname}{References}

  % Any bibliohgraphy style that leaves space between entries is fine
  \bibliographystyle{ecca}
  \bibliography{references}
\end{singlespacing}

% Appendices from all chapters should go at the end
\input{appendix}
